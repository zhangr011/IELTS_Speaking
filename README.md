I live in a two-bedroom apartment on the 9th floor of a tower block.
The bedrooms are small, but there's a spacious living room with a dining area and big windows, a modern kitchen, and also a small balcony where we can sit outside on sunny days.

I like my apartment because it's cosy and convenient for my job and my children's school, although it can be noisy because there is a shopping center just downstairs.

I live with my wife and my children. This is a very lively area just east of the city center. There are many cafes, shops and gyms to go.

I am quite a big fan of jogging during spare time.
I usually jog at the park near my home, sometimes alone and sometimes with my friends.
My brother got me into it because he loves sports.
At first, I found it frustrating and boring.
But now, I enjoy it.

As an aerobic exercise, jogging has helped me to improve my physical fitness and endurance.
I feel more energetic and refreshed after a good jog.
I believe that It's a great way to relieve stress and clear my mind, especially when I jog in nature.
