I live in an apartment on the 9th floor of a tower block. 
My house has two cosy bedrooms, a kitchen with a dining table, and a spacious living room with big windows.

I am quite a big fan of jogging during spare time. 
I usually jog at the park near my home, sometimes alone and sometimes with my friends. 
My brother got me into it because he loves sports. 
At first, I found it frustrating and boring.
But now, I enjoy it.

As an aerobic exercise, jogging has helped me to improve my physical fitness and endurance. 
I feel more energetic and refreshed after a good jog. 
I believe that It's a great way to relieve stress and clear my mind, especially when I jog in nature.
