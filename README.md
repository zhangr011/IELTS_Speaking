# PartI
## hometown
a sense of community

stressful, cost of living is very high. make ends meet.

I live in Guangzhou. It's a bustling megacity in southern China, which is famous for its landmarks such as the Canton Tower, Sacred Heart Cathedral and the Pearl River. It's also wellkown for its delicious Cantonese cuisine, of course.

I've lived here for about 10 years.

Traffic could be an issue in the city centre, but public transport such as subways, buses and shared bikes is very good here.

Guangzhou is almost unrecognisable compared to 20 or 30 years ago. The city has expaned so much, both physically and economically.
It's amazing when you see old photos of the cicy, things are so different now.

## home/family/neighbourhood
I live in a two-bedroom apartment on the 9th floor of a tower block.
The bedrooms are small, but there's a spacious living room with a dining area and big windows, a modern kitchen, and also a small balcony where we can sit outside on sunny days.

I like my apartment because it's cosy and convenient for getting to work and my children's school, although it can be noisy because there is a shopping center just downstairs.

I live with my wife and my children. This is a very lively area just east of the city center. There are many cafes, shops and gyms to go.

## hobbies/routines/sports
I am quite a big fan of jogging during spare time.
I usually jog at the park near my home, sometimes alone and sometimes with my friends.
My brother got me into it because he loves sports.
At first, I found it frustrating and boring.
But now, I enjoy it.

As an aerobic exercise, jogging has helped me to improve my physical fitness and endurance.
I feel more energetic and refreshed after a good jog.
I believe that It's a great way to relieve stress and clear my mind, especially when I jog in nature.
